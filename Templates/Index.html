        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ol> 
            <li>Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>Vanilla & salt</li>

        </ol>



        <h3>Use room temperature ingredients</h3>
        <P1> It's important that your cream cheese comes to room temperature before you begin making your cheesecake</P1>
        <p2>This will prevent any lumps and ensure a cheesecake with smooth, creamy texture.</p2>
        <p3>However, to ensure that all of your ingredients blend together nicely and give you the desired result, they should all be at room temperature before you begin.</p3>

        <h3>Take it easy on the Eggs</h3>
        <p1>Over-beating your Eggs is one of the quickest ways to ruin a cheesecake. Over-beating can ruin the texture and can cause cracks</p1>
        <p2>To prevent this, lightly scramble each egg before adding it into your batter</p2>
        <p3>Keep your mixer on low speed and stir until just combined. Be sure to pause after each addition and scrape down the sides and bottom of your mixing bowl</p3>

        <h3>D'ont open the oven</h3>
        <p1>I know how tempting it can be to want to check on your perfect, beautiful cheesecake, but wait until it's finished baking (or close to it) before opening the oven door!</p1>
        <p2>Yes, you will have to test for doneness at some point and there's a real possibility it will need more time in the oven, but minimize opening the oven as much as possible</p2>
        <p3>Opening the oven door can drastically reduce the temperature of your oven, which will slow the baking process and might cause your cheesecake to sink or cracks</p3>

        <h3> Free your crust!</h3>
        <p1>Once your cheesecake is done baking, allow it to cool 10 minutes on top of the stove. Then run a knife around the inside of the springform pan to loosen the crust from the sides</p1>
        <p2>As your cheesecake cools, it may to shrink a bit. If the crust is stuck to the pan, your crust wont't give but your cheesecake will (leaving you with cracks). Free the crust from the sides so it can contract with your filling as needed</p2>

        <h3>Cool at room temperature before moving to the fridge</h3>
        <p1>I always let my cheesecake come to room temperature before chilling. For bests results, let it cool as gradually as possible</p1>
        <p2>I put mine on top of my oven (the warmest spot in my house) so it can gradually Cool off as the oven does</p2>
        <p3>This <pre-chilling> cooling period can take an hour or two, but it's worth it. An abrupt temperature change (moving the Cheesecake directly from oven to fridge) is likely to make it crack</pre-chilling></p3>
